# INTERNSHIP_PROJECT
Regression Model to Predict Cement Compressive Strength

This is a machine learning project, and all of the projects are performed with a provided dataset.
In this project, we are predicting Cement Compressive Strength

Dataset - Dataset was provided by the YBI foundation, which included data about cement quality. 
Images - The images generated during the data analysis, and data visualization are displayed in the project.


Great experience. YBI foundation is a great platform for learning. This is a non-profit organization, so every internship and training is almost free and cheaper so that can afford everyone. The best part is that we get to learn through live interactive sessions and also implement the same through hands on practice projects. They also provided daily live classes and doubt session based on topic related to Machine Learning. After that We were also given the personal contact details of the instructor so that whenever we needed any help we could directly contact the instructor too.
